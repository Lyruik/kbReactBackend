    I want to take the query string and then manipulate it into an array of 2 strings. 

    I want 2 strings so one string can be ONLY alphanumeric characters. Example: someone searching for educam-360-c the first string would be educam360c ALWAYS.

    The second string I want to take any sort of hyphen or special character and create an underscore ' _ '. This underscore when it is used in SQL 
    counts as a single character wildcard, as opposed to the % modulus character that is ANY wildcard of ANY amount of characters between. 
    
    Let's start with defining the search query string and making an empty array
    */

    let arr = [];
    /* 
    Going to put it as lower case to start to try and avoid any complications it could make, the SQL query will match any case using iLIKE operator(?) 

    Now I want to transform this string to give me an array of two strings that look like this first string will be '%<string>%' and second string should look
    like '%<split of string>_<split of string>%' I specifically want the second one to be split once it encounters a hyphen OR transitions from alphabet to numeric
    so MS300 would be '%MS_300%' and then PTZ-C would be '%PTZ_C%'  ---- bonus points if I can get m-360-c to be '%m_360_c%'.

    We'll start on the first. We will want to try and split it based on numbers and hyphens/characters
    */

    I can get it to split any hyphens or underscores, but this doesn't split off numbers. I still want to be able to take ms300 and get ms_300. I am starting
    to think there is a much better way to get this, but struggling to find answers. I do have an idea of what would WORK, and for now we'll have to make due with it
